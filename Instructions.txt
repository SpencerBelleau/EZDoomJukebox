You'll need Python 3 for this to work, so get that (latest is 3.6.3 at time of writing).

Then you'll need tinytag, so open a command line window and type
	pip install tinytag
and it should auto-download.

From there, just stick your music into the Music\ subfolder and double click ezdoombox.py. You should see some output, and a pk3 will be made.
Enjoy your new jukebox!
